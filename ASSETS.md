# Assets and Images Guide

## Logo
- Place your logo image at: `assets/logo.png`

## Product Images
- Place sample images for products in the `assets/` folder:
  - `assets/sample-shoe.jpg` (for a footwear product)
  - `assets/sample-belt.jpg` (for a belt product)
  - `assets/sample-male-shoe.jpg` (for a male shoe)
  - `assets/sample-female-shoe.jpg` (for a female shoe)
  - `assets/sample-wallet.jpg` (for a wallet)
  - `assets/sample-watchbox.jpg` (for a watch roll box)

You can replace these with your own product images and update the `src` attributes in `index.html` as needed.
